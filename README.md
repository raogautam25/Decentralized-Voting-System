# Decentralized Voting System

A decentralized voting platform that combines:

- A browser-based voting and admin interface
- A Node.js Express server for page delivery and API proxying
- A FastAPI backend for voter management, QR verification, face matching, and audit storage
- A MongoDB database for persistent election data
- An Ethereum smart contract for on-chain vote recording and public verification

This project focuses on voter authenticity and election transparency by using:

- Duplicate voter prevention from stored face images during registration
- QR-based voter identification
- Live face verification against the registered voter image before vote enablement
- On-chain vote submission with public verification and explorer pages

## Core Features

- Admin login and voter login
- Voter registration with generated voter ID and QR code
- Face-based duplicate detection during voter registration
- Candidate nomination and candidate record management
- Election start, stop, restart, and date control
- QR scan based voter verification
- Live face match before vote authorization
- One QR token can vote only once
- Vote audit storage with captured images
- CSV vote audit export
- Public vote verification by transaction hash
- Public explorer for vote events and result transparency
- Optional sentiment feedback after confirmation, plus ML-driven vote prediction and anomaly detection insights

## Voting Flow

1. Admin registers a voter with name, date of birth, and face image.
2. The backend checks whether the uploaded face matches an already registered voter.
3. If registration succeeds, the system generates a voter ID and QR token.
4. On the voting page, the voter scans the QR code.
5. The system fetches the stored voter record and captures a live image.
6. The backend compares the live image with the registered voter photo.
7. After QR verification, the voter presses `OK (Ready)`.
8. A second live face match is performed for ready-to-vote authorization.
9. Candidate buttons unlock only after successful verification.
10. The voter selects a candidate and confirms within 15 seconds.
11. The vote is written to the blockchain and audit data is stored in the backend.
12. The voter session is cleared automatically for the next voter.
13. A short optional feedback textarea appears on the loading screen and, if filled, stores sentiment details for each candidate.

## Voter Authenticity Features

### Registration-time duplicate prevention

When a new voter is registered, the uploaded photo is compared with existing stored voter images. This helps stop the same person from registering multiple times under different names.

### Voting-time face verification

During voting, the system compares:

- The registered voter ID-card image
- The live image captured from the camera

This check happens:

- During QR confirmation
- Again during the `OK (Ready)` step before voting is enabled

### Strict face threshold

The project supports strict face verification using:

- `LIVE_FACE_VERIFICATION_THRESHOLD`

Current `.env` example:

```env
LIVE_FACE_VERIFICATION_THRESHOLD=0.94
```

Higher values make the match stricter but can also reject genuine voters if lighting or angle changes too much.

## Key Backend APIs

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/login` | Role-based authentication |
| `/admin/voters` | Register voter and generate voter record |
| `/admin/candidate-nominations/check` | Candidate duplicate and rule validation |
| `/admin/candidate-nominations` | Save nomination record |
| `/admin/candidates` | Save candidate metadata |
| `/admin/election/dates` | Save election time window |
| `/admin/election/stop` | Stop election |
| `/admin/election/restart` | Restart or reconduct election |
| `/voter/by-qr` | Fetch voter record by QR token |
| `/voter/confirm-scan` | Verify QR voter with live face image |
| `/voter/ready-check` | Perform ready-to-vote live face match |
| `/vote/audit` | Save audit trail after successful vote |
| `/vote/report` | Fetch live vote report |
| `/vote/prediction` | Predict final vote counts, winner, and confidence with LinearRegression insights |
| `/vote/sentiment-report` | Aggregate voter feedback sentiment per candidate (requires optional feedback submission) |
| `/admin/vote-audit/export` | Download vote audit CSV |
| `/admin/database/clear` | Clear database records and media |
| `/admin/anomaly-report` | Admin-only vote rate anomaly windows detected with Isolation Forest |

## Machine Learning Enhancements

- **Vote prediction** (`LinearRegression` via `scikit-learn`) consumes current vote counts, audit history, and registered voter totals to forecast final counts, winner, and confidence on `/vote/prediction`.
- **Sentiment analysis** (VADER via `vaderSentiment`) captures the optional feedback textarea on the loading screen, stores sentiment label/score in each audit row, and exposes aggregates per candidate at `/vote/sentiment-report`.
- **Anomaly detection** (`IsolationForest` via `scikit-learn`) reviews vote timestamps from the audit collection and reports suspicious fast voting windows to admins through `/admin/anomaly-report` after JWT role validation.

## Smart Contract Responsibilities

The smart contract in `contracts/Voting.sol` is responsible for:

- Storing candidates
- Storing vote counts
- Storing election start and end dates
- Preventing repeated vote submission from the same QR token
- Emitting vote events for public auditability

Main contract methods:

- `addCandidate`
- `vote`
- `voteByQr`
- `checkVote`
- `checkVoteByQr`
- `setDates`
- `getDates`
- `getCandidate`
- `getCountCandidates`

## Contract Deployment Notes

This project can work with:

- A local development chain such as Ganache
- A configured Ethereum-compatible network through `.env`

If you are using Truffle local development network:

```powershell
npx truffle migrate --reset --network development
```

If you redeploy the contract, update:

- `VOTING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
- runtime configuration if needed

## Audit and Reporting

The system stores an audit trail for each vote that can include:

- voter ID
- candidate ID
- candidate name
- party name
- transaction hash
- pre-vote captured image
- on-vote-day verification image
- vote time

Administrators can:

- download CSV reports
- view live backend vote totals
- inspect public blockchain results separately through explorer and verify pages

## Security and Integrity Notes

- Duplicate faces are blocked at voter registration time
- QR token reuse is blocked at smart-contract level
- Live face verification is required before voting
- Voting can be stopped centrally through the admin panel
- Public verification is available through blockchain event decoding
- Clearing backend data does not clear blockchain data
